# Managing Ziti

Ziti management needs to be hands off. The only times one should be expected to be concerned with managing a Ziti
instance is during the initial installation and when trying to expand the Ziti footprint.

## Initial Installation

### Ziti Edge - Developer Edition

An initial, simple installation of Ziti is already done for you when using the [Ziti Edge - Developer
Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YZLKMLV).  The installation will contain a
[controller](./controller-overview.md), an [edge router](./edge-router.md) and corresponding [PKI](~/ziti/manage/pki.md). See the corresponding
sections for additional details.

## Expanding Ziti

At this time Ziti is only offered as the [Ziti Edge - Developer
Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YZLKMLV) which is not expandable beyond a single node at this time. As
you would exepct, allowing Ziti to be expanded past the developer experience is planned. Check back in the coming months for more information.
