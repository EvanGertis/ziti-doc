# Ziti Router

A Ziti Router is a process that is installed on a host which allows it to participate in a Ziti network.  There are two
types of routers: edge routers and fabric routers.

At this time the edge router is available for use with a Ziti Edge - Developer Edition
([AWS](~/ziti/quickstarts/network/aws-quickstart.md)/[Azure](~/ziti/quickstarts/network/azure-quickstart.md)). Support
for fabric routers is planned soon.
