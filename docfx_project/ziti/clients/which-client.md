# Choosing a client

Once you have a Ziti Network - you are going to require a Ziti-aware client in order to access the network. There are
two basic choices to make. Either use a tunneler or an SDK.

Choosing which type of client you will use to connect to a Ziti Network is very straightfoward and comes down to a
single question. If you are you installing Ziti in front of an existing application which has already been developed and
deployed you need to use a [tunneler](tunneler.md).  If you are developing a new product and starting from scratch and
you want to take advantage of a fully zero-trust solution you will probably want to use an SDK.
