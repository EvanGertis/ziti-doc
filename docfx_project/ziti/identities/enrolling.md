## Enrolling an Identity

All connections made to the Ziti network leverage [mutual TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication)
which means every client needs a valid X509 certificate which it will present to the Ziti network during the connection
process. The process of obtaining a certificate and presenting it to the Ziti controller is called "Enrollment".

## Overview

All identities need to be enrolled with the Ziti controller.  This process is somewhat complex and it's important you
understand the process fully to ensure safe and secure handling of the required secrets.  It is recommended that you use
the `ziti-enroller`

### Certificates

The certificate a Ziti Edge client presents can be generated by the Ziti Controller using the configured PKI or this
certificate can come from a existing PKI not controlled by the Ziti Controller. Certificates which are not created by
the Ziti Controller are referred to as "3rd Party" because from the perspective of the Ziti controller the certificates
are not from the configured PKI.

## One Time Token Enrollment - Internal PKI

Perhaps the easiest enrollment mechanism is to use the one time token enrollment flow along with the internally
configured PKI. This enrollment flow leverages the tools developed by NetFoundry to securely enroll an identity.
